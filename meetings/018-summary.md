Here’s the structured summary of the Open Canvas Working Group (OCWG) meeting:

---

### **Major Discussion Points**

- **Transclusion in the Spec**  
  Transclusion was previously thought to be missing from the spec, but it was discovered that it is already inherently supported through parent-child relations. A new document called the *Cookbook* was created to explain how to use this feature.

- **Defining Visual Node Shapes**  
  There was debate over whether primitive shapes like ovals should be considered distinct types or treated as resource-based elements like text and images. Some members preferred keeping simple geometric shapes as top-level visual elements rather than treating them as resources.

- **SVG vs. Custom Resource Types**  
  The group discussed whether to use SVG paths for shapes or define custom JSON resource types (e.g., an "oval" resource type with properties like width, height, and stroke). A simpler custom format was seen as beneficial.

- **Conceptual vs. Visual Canvases**  
  The group considered whether certain design choices should prioritize visual canvases (e.g., whiteboarding apps) or conceptual canvases (e.g., auto-layout diagrams). This decision impacts how geometry and spatial positioning are handled.

- **Z-Ordering of Visual Elements**  
  There was discussion about whether shapes should always appear on top of their associated resources (e.g., an oval should overlay an image). The consensus leaned toward defining a recommended Z-order but allowing implementers flexibility.

- **Multiple Resources per Node**  
  Currently, each node can only have one resource. A potential extension was suggested to allow a "background resource" for cases like text overlaid on an image.

- **Z-Index Handling**  
  The visual node Z-index determines layering, but there was discussion on whether nodes themselves should have a Z-index. The current approach is to allow optional Z-coordinates that define stacking order.

- **Layering as a Relation Type**  
  A "layer" relation type was proposed to allow grouping of elements that can be moved together while maintaining individual Z-ordering. This would be distinct from "sets" or "groups."

- **Transclusion as a Node or Relation Extension**  
  The group debated whether transclusion (inheritance from another node) should be a node extension or a relation extension. Keeping it as a relation extension was preferred for flexibility.

- **Demo of Codeflow Canvas Integration**  
  Michael showcased a demo of importing an Open Canvas Exchange Format (OCIF) file into Codeflow Canvas, highlighting challenges and successes with integrating OCIF into real-world applications.

- **Exporting OCIF Files to TLDraw**  
  A method for exporting OCIF files to TLDraw was demonstrated, showing how nodes and their connections were represented.

- **Handling Shared Resources in OCIF**  
  There was discussion on how to manage resources shared by multiple nodes, particularly ensuring that updates propagate correctly.

- **Encouraging OCIF Adoption**  
  The group considered ways to encourage adoption, including targeting simpler tools like Obsidian Canvas and writing converters to popular formats.

### **Action Items**
- Review the 0.3 draft of the spec and finalize it within 24-48 hours.  
- Add documentation on best practices for handling shared resources in the *Cookbook*.  
- Consider implementing a background resource extension to allow multiple resources per node.  
- Investigate ways to encourage adoption of OCIF, possibly by developing conversion tools for Obsidian Canvas and TLDraw.  
- Continue refining Codeflow Canvas integration and improving export options.

---

### **Takeaways**
- The *Cookbook* will help clarify existing features like transclusion.  
- Keeping primitive shapes as top-level visual elements may simplify implementation.  
- A clear Z-ordering policy will improve consistency across different canvas implementations.  
- Using a structured approach to defining resources (instead of relying on SVG) could simplify implementation.  
- OCIF’s success depends on providing compelling use cases and easy-to-use conversion tools.
