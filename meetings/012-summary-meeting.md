**Discussion Points:**

- **Types of Relations**: The group discussed how relations could be represented, such as directed and undirected edges, and debated whether bidirectional edges are necessary or redundant.
- **Logical and Visual Representations**: Participants explored the logical distinctions between nodes connected by labels "from" and "to," emphasizing the need for clarity in visual representations and sorting edges.
- **Edge Type and Metadata**: The team considered the importance of representing the type of an edge (e.g., using RDF URIs) and how metadata should be attached to relations for clarity and reusability.
- **Ports in Nodes**: There was an extensive discussion on the role of ports in visual programming, how they relate to nodes, and how they could be conceptualized as both visual and logical entities.
- **Modeling Ports and Relations**: The team examined how to represent the connection between ports and nodes, considering options for port arrays and direct relational storage.
- **Reusability and Schema Definitions**: The idea of allowing nodes and ports to hold metadata and schema properties was discussed to simplify implementation and ensure reusability.
- **Sets and Groups**: The concept of sets containing nodes or relations and their ability to form recursive structures was introduced, with extensions for logical relationships like groups and frames.
- **Challenges with Hyper Edges**: Participants noted the complexity of modeling hyper edges and the lack of a mathematical consensus, leaving further exploration to specific contributors.
- **Documentation Strategy**: A plan to unify design decisions and create a more structured document, potentially including JSON and visual examples, was discussed.
- **Tools for Visual Representation**: The use of PlantUML and its advantages over other tools like Mermaid was mentioned, along with preferences for documentation formats like Markdown and AsciiDoc.

**Takeaways:**

- The meeting solidified the approach to handling ports and edges, reinforcing the need for clear logical and visual distinctions.
- The consensus on metadata and edge types pointed towards using RDF-like structures for more advanced implementations.
- The use of PlantUML and Markdown/AsciiDoc for creating and sharing documentation was highlighted as beneficial for the team's workflow.
