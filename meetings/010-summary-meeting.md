### Major Discussion Points

- **Specification Development**
  - The group discussed the ongoing development of an extensible and interoperable specification for infinite canvases. The focus is on creating a human-readable version that simplifies understanding compared to JSON schemas, which are viewed as implementation details.

- **Combining Files and Merging PRs**
  - There was agreement on merging separate files back into one combined file on GitHub. The team aims to ensure internal consistency and highlight open questions before finalizing this change.

- **Node, Relation, Resource, and Schema Structure**
  - The participants confirmed the structure of the specification would include four main arrays: nodes, relations, resources, and schemas. They explored how resources relate to nodes and emphasized the importance of clarity in the documentation.

- **ID Management**
  - The discussion included the pros and cons of using unique IDs versus indexing in referencing resources. The semantic web's approach of using globally unique IDs was contrasted with the GLTF method of using indices, leading to a preference for unique string IDs for flexibility.

- **Caching Considerations**
  - The group considered whether caching should be addressed in the specification. It was suggested that local resources should be self-contained within the JSON file, making caching less relevant for the initial version of the specification.

- **Extensibility and Schema Features**
  - Extensibility was a key point, particularly regarding how to allow for schema support in both resources and relations. There was a proposal to merge schema versioning into a single property for simplicity.

- **JSON Linked Data**
  - The conversation touched on how JSON linked data (JSON-LD) might interact with the schema, focusing on how it could provide unique identifiers and facilitate the linking of resources and nodes.

### Action Items

- **Merge Files on GitHub**
  - Merge the separate files into one combined file to simplify the structure and documentation.

- **Explore TypeScript vs. JSON Schema**
  - Investigate the differences between TypeScript types and JSON schemas for better readability and usability in the specification.

- **Document Structure of Nodes and Resources**
  - Ensure clear documentation of the relationships between nodes and resources in the specification.

- **Continue Discussion on Caching and IDs**
  - Further explore the implications of caching and unique ID requirements in future meetings.

### Takeaways

- The team is committed to making the specification human-readable and easily understandable.
- There is a strong preference for using unique string IDs to avoid potential issues with indexing and resource management.
- The design goals include flexibility for future extensions, allowing for adaptations as the specification evolves.
- The next meeting will continue to build on the current progress and explore outstanding issues, particularly around JSON-LD and extensibility.
