Here are the major discussion points, action items, and takeaways from the meeting:

### Major Discussion Points

- **SSL Issues**: Discussion on SSL issues identified with the specification setup; the issues are known and there are plans to address them post-meeting.
  
- **Hello World File Demo**: Michael demonstrated importing a "Hello World" file, noting issues between different operating systems and his intentions to keep imported data as minimal and clean as possible.
  
- **Positioning in Oakiff**: Aaron raised concerns about how positions are defined in Oakiff, questioning whether they should be global or relative. The discussion touched on the complications each method could introduce, especially with animations and the structure of the document.
  
- **Usage of OCIF as a Data Format**: There was a conversation on whether OCIF should be used purely as an exchange format or if it should also accommodate internal data structures of applications, impacting how animations and other dynamic elements are handled.
  
- **Group vs. Parent-Child Relations in Oakiff**: The difference and usage of group relations and parent-child relations were discussed, highlighting the need for clarity on when to use each and how they should be implemented in the spec.

### Action Items

- **Fix SSL Issues**: The person who raised the SSL issues committed to fixing them after the meeting.
  
- **Update OCIF Spec**: Plans to clarify how positions are handled within the OCIF documentation, specifically addressing Aaron's concerns about positioning and its implications for animations.

### Takeaways

- **Flexibility of OCIF**: The meeting underscored OCIF's potential flexibility as both a data interchange and internal data structure format, suggesting further exploration into its capabilities.
  
- **Need for Clear Definitions**: It became evident that clearer definitions and guidelines are needed in the OCIF spec, particularly regarding how different types of relationships and positioning should be handled to accommodate various user needs and technical environments.

These insights reflect the ongoing development and refinement needed in the OCIF specification to make it robust and versatile for various applications and user scenarios.
