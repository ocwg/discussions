### **Major Discussion Points**

- **Adoption Feedback from Michael**  
  Michael shared his initial impressions as the first adopter of the tool, noting that he was impressed but needed more examples and documentation to understand specific functionalities, such as exporting to OKF format.

- **Examples and Documentation**  
  Participants discussed the need for comprehensive examples covering all core and extended features in the specification. They proposed creating a "kitchen sink" document to demonstrate everything cohesively and aid in adoption.

- **Export and Interoperability**  
  The group explored the need for export functionality, focusing on exporting OKF to TL Draw as a starting point. They also discussed the challenges of maintaining compatibility and supporting round-trip conversions between tools.

- **Compositions and Transclusion**  
  There was an in-depth discussion on handling compositions and transclusions in visual programming. Topics included nested compositions, inheriting properties like position and size, and maintaining unique identifiers for transcluded nodes.

- **Validator and Converters**  
  A validator for OKF and converters between formats (e.g., OKF to TL Draw) were identified as critical tools for ensuring interoperability and aiding adoption among developers.

- **Community Outreach**  
  Participants discussed strategies to raise awareness, such as creating a demo video, posting in relevant communities (e.g., Future of Code Slack), and sending an email newsletter announcing version 0.2.

- **Use of LLMs for Spec and Validator**  
  The team highlighted the potential of leveraging language models (LLMs) to assist in creating validators, generating JSON examples, and refining the spec.

### **Action Items**

1. **Examples and Documentation**  
   - Max to draft a single example demonstrating the use of all core features and extensions, which will serve as a foundation for documentation.
   - Team to create a "kitchen sink" document showing how elements interconnect.

2. **Export and Interoperability**  
   - Max to work on the OKF to TL Draw export module.  
   - Michael to continue refining his tool's export to OKF functionality.

3. **Validator Development**  
   - Begin exploring the development of a validator for OKF format. Use LLMs to draft initial versions of the validator.

4. **Community Outreach**  
   - Michael to record a demo video and share it in Discord and the Future of Code Slack.  
   - Another team member (unnamed) to send out the email newsletter announcing version 0.2.

5. **LLM Integration**  
   - Experiment with using LLMs to create JSON examples and refine the spec further.

### **Takeaways**

- Clear examples and a comprehensive spec are essential for adoption.
- Validator and converter tools can significantly enhance interoperability and ease of use.
- Community engagement, such as posting updates and demos, is crucial for building interest.
- Nested compositions and transclusion are complex but necessary features for advanced use cases.
- Leveraging LLMs for technical tasks can accelerate development and improve documentation quality.
