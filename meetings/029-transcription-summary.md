- **Root Node and Nesting Canvas Proposals**  
  Aaron presented his recent implementation of the root node and nesting canvas proposals in Oakiff, demonstrating how scene instances and node renaming work across nested scenes. The discussion highlighted how these features enable complex scene trees and reusability of nested UI systems across multiple files.

- **Node Renaming and Overriding Mechanisms**  
  The group discussed the host canvas overriding imported nodes’ properties, emphasizing the power and complexity of this feature. They acknowledged the need to better define how arrays of extensions should merge or override to align with intuitive expectations, especially for overrides in nested scenes.

- **Handling Invalid Properties in Specification**  
  Aaron suggested making the spec strict by marking certain invalid property combinations as errors, while others preferred a permissive approach of ignoring invalid properties but issuing warnings. The consensus leaned towards emitting warnings and having validators inform users about spec violations without failing outright.

- **Canvas Extensions Concept**  
  The group explored expanding the extensions framework to include "canvas extensions," a third category alongside node and relation extensions, to support properties applicable to the entire canvas, like camera view boxes. This was seen as a natural and minimal change to the spec structure.

- **Themes and Recursive Theming via Extensions**  
  Aaron presented an initial theme extension proposal allowing nesting themes within themes, enabling recursive theming (e.g., dark mode, font size overrides) applied at the root node or sub-nodes. The approach leverages existing extension mechanisms but requires further refinement and examples.

- **Color Palettes as Extensions**  
  Discussion on representing color palettes as canvas or root node extensions concluded that these palettes could allow semantic color naming and overriding. However, concerns were raised about whether named colors need to be part of the spec or handled by exporters/importers mapping them directly to hex codes.

- **Michael’s Oakiff Library and Tools Mono Repo**  
  Michael demonstrated his ongoing work creating a mono repo with a shared Oakiff library powering multiple apps, including JSON-Converse converters and Node.js APIs. Plans include migrating this work into the main repo and publishing the library to NPM under an organizational account.

### Action Items

- Define the exact behavior for overriding arrays of extensions in host vs imported nodes to ensure intuitive property merging.  
- Clarify schema validation strategy for invalid properties: adopt a permissive approach with warnings plus updates to validator tooling.  
- Add support for canvas-level extensions in the spec, including a data property at the top-level canvas schema for extensibility.  
- Draft additional theming examples and consider alternative theming designs for better conceptual clarity.  
- Set up an organizational NPM account for publishing the Oakiff library; coordinate transfer/move of Michael’s repo into the main project.  
- Document conventions for extension naming and usage across nodes, relations, and canvas to unify and simplify extension management.

---

### Takeaways

- The root node and nesting canvas proposals provide a powerful foundation for complex and modular scene management in Oakiff.  
- Overriding and inheritance in nested scenes require careful specification, especially around merging extension data arrays.  
- A permissive, warning-based approach to spec validation is preferred to maximize interoperability while alerting users to issues.  
- Canvas extensions open up extensibility at the document level, fitting well within the existing extensions framework.  
- Recursive theming through nested extensions is a promising approach but needs further exploration and validation.  
- Handling color palettes via extensions or exporter/importer logic remains an open design question.  
- Michael’s mono repo with shared Oakiff tooling marks significant progress toward better ecosystem tooling and implementation consistency.
